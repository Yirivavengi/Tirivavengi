    <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Pages Website</h1>

    <p>
        This webpage was created as part of an assignment to learn how
        to publish and host a website using GitHub Pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        GitHub Pages allows users to host static websites for free
        using a GitHub repository.
    </p>

    <p>
        The focus of this website is not the content, but the process
        of creating, publishing, and hosting a webpage online.
